# TopschoolCliApp

I would like to build a CLI Application with Top 10 Engineering Universities in US

1. User input which field of Top 10 Engineering Schools they would like to know
2. User will get a list of 10 Engineering Schools in that field, ie. Top Electrial Engineering Schools in US
3. Cli will ask user if they would like to know more details of one of the top 10 Schools
4. User gives a number like 3 then cli will list the 3rd school name and school url for their reference

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
